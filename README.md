# MLLB\_\_DL\_\_Medical\_Image\_Segmentation



This project is part of the MLLB course (Master of Science in Signal Processing and Machine Learning for Big Data). It focuses on applying deep learning approaches for the segmentation of abdominal organs from MRI images, inspired by the Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation (CHAOS) Challenge 2019.



The work was carried out collaboratively by two students, covering both experimental implementation and analysis.



The repository contains scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, organization, exploratory analysis, and model development. This is a preliminary version; ongoing experiments and further improvements will be included in the final version.
